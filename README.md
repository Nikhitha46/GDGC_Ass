## Getting Started with the Shopping Cart App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses a simple shopping cart system that fetches product data from a fake store API, with features like adding products to the cart, updating quantities, and calculating total cost, GST, and other charges.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes to the code.<br />
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the default build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.
